# Ford GoBike Dataset Analysis

### The purpose of the project is to clean Ford GoBike (Currently Bay Wheels) dataset and explore the data and share insights. The dataset contains bike rides information from jan 2018 till march 2020

## Summary of Insights:

The dataset has over 5 million records of trips, i looked mainly on the usage trends in general and then used the user type segments to extract user behavior like usage peak hours/weekday 

Research Questions: 
    
    1. What is the trips trend over the past two years?
    2. Does this trend differs between different user types?
    3. What is the percentage share of each user type?
    4. What is the trend of bike rides over weekday?
    5. What are the peak hours of usage for each user type?
    
    
The usage of GoBike had an increasing trend over the past 2 years, even thought there was always a seasonality during winter. But in the last month (March 2020) the usage have been declining so fast due to the current Pandemic situation.

Usually most of the users are subscribers and they have different usage trends than customers, where customers are less affected by seasonality or weekdays for example.

Subscribers usually prefer to take more rides during the weekday and they also prefer to take those rides during the early morning and the evening. this mean that probably the subscribers use bikes as a main way of transportation to go to work or to go out in the evening
